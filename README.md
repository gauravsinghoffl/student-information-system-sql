# 📚 Student Information System (SIS) – SQL-Based Database Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is a comprehensive SQL-based implementation of a **Student Information System (SIS)**. It covers all foundational aspects of database design, data manipulation, and data analysis through SQL queries. The goal is to simulate the backend of a real-world academic system managing students, courses, enrollments, payments, and teachers.
